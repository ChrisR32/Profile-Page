### Mobile viewing
I dropped the ball here, I couldn't get flex box to work corectly and I thought mobile would work as I used CSS grid, but I think I over complicated the grids and the sites mobile viewing isn't good at all. Everything I tried to do to fix it created more problems and I think I would need to redesign it. So with the deadline nearing I kept the site how it was.

### Different Themes
I made 4 themes with seperate CSS files, I tried to have a bit of fun with this especially between light and dark. I didn't have enough time left to get the css to stick on all the pages after clicking the first time, so I placed links in the footers to change the seperate pages.

Dark Mode:

 an idea of how to plan, it also had pictures from things for ideas on the looks.
